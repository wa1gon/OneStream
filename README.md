This is a sample app to demo my skills as .NET developer with Blazor WASM with WebAPI backend.  

This app will take a US Amateur Callsign as input, fetch the callsign owner information, and then display it on the screen.  Once on the local server, the callsign information is cached in a memory repository. Working callsigns are WA1GON and KB1ETC.

TODO List

* Add Entity Frame Repository
* Move validation to the common
